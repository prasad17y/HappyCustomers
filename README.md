# HappyCustomers - User Management App

**HappyCustomers** is a React Native application designed to display, filter, and manage a list of users. The app emphasizes **code quality, maintainability, and offline-first functionality**. It integrates with a GraphQL API to fetch user data and persists it in a local database, ensuring a seamless user experience even without a network connection.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Offline-First**: User data is stored in a local **WatermelonDB** database, making the app fully functional offline. The UI is always powered by the local database.  
- **GraphQL Integration**: Fetches user data from an **AWS AppSync GraphQL API** using **Apollo Client**.  
- **Efficient Data Sync**: Only fetches new data when the local cache is empty or stale (older than 24 hours), reducing unnecessary network requests.  
- **Reactive UI**: Automatically updates when the underlying data changes.  
- **Advanced Filtering & UI**: Swipe between **All**, **Admin**, and **Manager** lists with `react-native-pager-view`, smooth animated tab indicator, and pull-to-refresh functionality.  
- **User Search**: Debounced, case-insensitive search bar (toggleable).  
- **User Creation**: Add new users via a modal form with schema-based validation powered by **Formik + Yup**.  
- **Robust State Management**: Uses **Redux + redux-observable** to manage state and side effects like sync status.  
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Built with reusable, optimized, and well-structured components.
